/*
 * -----------------------------
 * ‚úÖ Time Complexity Analysis:
 * -----------------------------
 * The function uses a divide-and-conquer approach:
 *   - In each recursive call, we divide the exponent `n` by 2.
 *   - This results in a recursion depth of approximately log‚ÇÇ(n).
 *
 * Each level of recursion does a constant amount of work (1 multiplication or squaring),
 * so the total number of operations is proportional to log‚ÇÇ(n).
 *
 * üëâ Therefore, Time Complexity = O(log n)
 *
 * This is much faster than the naive approach (which would take O(n) time).

 *
 * ------------------------------
 * ‚úÖ Space Complexity Analysis:
 * ------------------------------
 * Since we're using recursion, each recursive call is added to the call stack.
 * The maximum number of calls on the stack at any point is equal to the recursion depth,
 * which is also log‚ÇÇ(n), because we halve `n` at every step.
 *
 * No additional data structures are used ‚Äî only variables for calculations.
 *
 * üëâ Therefore, Space Complexity = O(log n) due to the recursive call stack.
 *
 * ‚ùó Note:
 * - This space can be optimized to O(1) by converting the algorithm to an iterative version,
 *   which is often preferred in production environments to avoid stack overflow.
